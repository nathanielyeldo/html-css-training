        <h3>College Information Chatbot</h3>
        <p>
          The college information chatbot is an advanced AI system designed to
          provide prospective students with comprehensive and personalized
          information about colleges and universities, streamlining the college
          search process. By leveraging fine-tuned generative algorithms and
          extensive analytics, the chatbot continuously improves its
          functionalities and tailors responses to individual needs, creating a
          valuable resource for students and optimizing the admissions staff's
          efficiency.
        </p>
        <h3>Extremist Post Detection Using Deep Learning</h3>
        <p>
          Extremist Groups are using social media sites like Facebook, Twitter
          and Instagram to increasingly pro- mote their ideologies and recruit
          individuals for terrorist activities. This work aims at reducing the
          impact of such posts by classifying them into two: extremist and
          non-extremist classes. Using a LSTM + RNN model we train the
          classification model to classify the posts as extremist and non
          extremist.
