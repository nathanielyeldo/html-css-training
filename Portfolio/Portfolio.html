          <h2>College Information Chatbot</h2>
          <p>
            The college information chatbot is an advanced AI system designed to
            provide prospective students with comprehensive and personalized
            information about colleges and universities, streamlining the
            college search process. By leveraging fine-tuned generative
            algorithms and extensive analytics, the chatbot continuously
            improves its functionalities and tailors responses to individual
            needs, creating a valuable resource for students and optimizing the
            admissions staff's efficiency.

          <h2>Extremist Post Detection Using Deep Learning</h2>
          <p>
            Extremist Groups are using social media sites like Facebook, Twitter
            and Instagram to increasingly pro- mote their ideologies and recruit
            individuals for terrorist activities. This work aims at reducing the
            impact of such posts by classifying them into two: extremist and
            non-extremist classes. Using a LSTM + RNN model we train the
            classification model to classify the posts as extremist and non
            extremist.

          <div class="aboutmebg">
            <p>
              I am Nathaniel Yeldo, a dedicated Software Engineer with a proven
              track record in creating robust and efficient software solutions.
              Armed with a solid education in Computer Science Engineering and a
              wealth of hands-on experience, I approach each project with
              precision and a commitment to excellence. <br />
              <br />
              My professional portfolio encompasses a range of projects, from
              pioneering AI systems to discerning extremist content, to
              developing user-centric applications that enhance information
              accessibility.
              <br />
              <br />
              Beyond the realm of technology, I find solace in the harmonies of
              music and the narratives of cinema. These pursuits not only serve
              as personal interests but also serve to enrich my creative
              thinking and problem-solving skills. <br />
              <br />
              I am continually seeking opportunities to explore emerging
              technologies and to collaborate on ventures with the potential to
              effect substantial change. Should you wish to discuss potential
              collaborations or have inquiries, please do not hesitate to reach
              out.
              <br />
              <br />
              Thank you for considering my portfolio. I look forward to the
              prospect of working together.

          <h1>Extracurricular Activities</h1>
          <p>
            <b>Music Enthusiast</b>: I have a deep passion for music, both as a
            listener and a singer. This hobby has not only provided me with
            immense joy but has also honed my sense of rhythm and appreciation
            for diverse musical genres. <br /><br />
            <b>Movie Buff</b>: Exploring the world of cinema is a cherished
            pastime. It allows me to delve into storytelling, cinematography,
            and the art of visual narrative. This interest has influenced my
            approach to design and user experience in software development.
            <br /><br />
            <b>Badminton Player</b>: Engaging in sports has always been an
            essential part of my routine. Playing badminton not only keeps me
            physically active but also fosters qualities like teamwork, focus,
            and agility, which I find to be invaluable in my professional
            endeavors. <br /><br />
            These extracurricular activities not only enrich my personal life
            but also contribute to a well-rounded skill set that I bring to my
            professional pursuits. They instill discipline, creativity, and a
            sense of balance, all of which are reflected in my approach to
            software engineering. <br /><br />
